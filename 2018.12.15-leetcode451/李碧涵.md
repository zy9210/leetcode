#### [451. Sort Characters By Frequency](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-characters-by-frequency/)

**题目描述**
> 给定字符串，基于字符出现的次数，对其降序排序。

**例子**
> **Example 1:**
Input:"tree"
Output:"eert"

Explanation:
'e' appears twice while 'r' and 't' both appear once.
So 'e' must appear before both 'r' and 't'. Therefore "eetr" is also a valid answer.

> **Example 2:**
Input:"cccaaa"
Output:"cccaaa"
Explanation:
Both 'c' and 'a' appear three times, so "aaaccc" is also a valid answer.
Note that "cacaca" is incorrect, as the same characters must be together.

> **Example 3:**
Input:"Aabb"
Output:"bbAa"

Explanation:
"bbaA" is also a valid answer, but "Aabb" is incorrect.
Note that 'A' and 'a' are treated as two different characters.

**思想**
直观想法，字典存储每个元素出现的次数。然后对字典按值降序排序sorted(dic.items(), key = lambda x:x[1], reverse = True)，最后拼接出字符串。

**解法**
```python
class Solution(object):
    def frequencySort(self, s):
        """
        :type s: str
        :rtype: str
        """
        dic = {}
        for c in s:
            if c not in dic:
                dic[c] = 1
            else:
                dic[c] += 1
        
        new = sorted(dic.items(), key = lambda x:x[1], reverse = True)
        
        ss = ''
        for c, t in new:
            ss += c * t
        return ss
```
